    "\n",
    "LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending network that connects borrowers to investors and facilitates the payment of loans ranging from \\\\$1,000 to \\\\$40,000. Investors review the loan applications, and make decisions based on risk analysis provided by Lending Club, or their own strategies. Despite being an “Equal Housing Lender”, Lending Club is the site of possible discrimination or unfair lending practices. Studies show that the federal Fair Housing Act has failed in the past to stop discrimination with regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap, or familial status when approving loans.\n",
